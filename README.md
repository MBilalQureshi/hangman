# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game that was actually introduced in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes. At that time, it lacks the image of the hangman which was later introduced in 1902.

This is a mind and logic game. This game can be easy but very challenging at the same time but in any case it helps the players to learn new words and add new set of vocabulary they can use in their daily life routine. The player has 7 tries and after that the hangman gets well hanged. For users learning purpose the word will be shown after last try.

## Libraries and Technologies Used
### Python Libraries
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) is used for putting normal game flow to sleep.
- [randrange](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is used to select a random word for list of words.
- [datetime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/) is used to get current date and time for the last three players entry.
- [gspread](https://pypi.org/project/gspread/) is used for communication with Google Sheets.
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used to validate credentials and grant access to google service accounts.

### Programs Used
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) used to host repository.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) used to develop project and organize version control.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) used to deploy the live project.
- [PEP8 Online](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) used to validate all the Python code.

## Deployment
### Heroku
The site was deployed using Heroku and the live link can be found here: [Hangman](https://hangman-frenzy-4d545907a764.herokuapp.com/).
1. Before actual deployment use "Heroku pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" on Gitpod console. This will add all the dependencies in requirements.txt file which will be needed by Heroku later during deployment.
2. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
3. On main page there is an option to create new app, click it.
4. Enter a unique application name and select your region.
5. Click on create app button.
6. Click settings and select Config Vars.
7. Click Reveal Config Vars and enter Key as "PORT" and Value as "8000" and press add button.
8. Input CREDS and the content of your Google Sheet API creds file as another config var and click add.
9. Scoll down on same page and add build packs, select "python" and click save.
10. Add another build pack "NodeJs" and click save.
11. Make sure python build pack is on top of NodeJs.
12. Go to top of page and select deploy option.
13. Select Github as deployment method.
14. Confirm to connect with github and auotherize Heroku from Github.
15. In search bar type repository name and click the connect button.
16. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
17. Click View to view the deployed site.


### Forking the GitHub Repository
With Forking one can make a copy of a repository and to view or make changes in it without affecting the original repository. Following are the steps to do this.
1. Log in to GitHub and locate [Hangman](https://github.com/MBilalQureshi/hangman) repository.
2. At the top right side of the page just below the navigation bar, locate the fork button.
3. You will now have a copy of the repository.

### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to GitHub and locate [Hangman](https://github.com/MBilalQureshi/hangman) repository.
2. Just below the repository name, click "Code".
3. There is an option to copy HTTPS link. Press copy icon.
5. Open Git Bash on local machine.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where we want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type git clone on bash and paste the HTTPS URL we copied earlier.
6. Press Enter. local clone will be created.
